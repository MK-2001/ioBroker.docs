Viessmann E3 series devices (One Base) are doing a lot of data exchanges on CAN bus. This adapter can listen to this communication and extract much useful information. Energy meters E380CA and E3100CB also are supported. This mode of operation is called `Collect`.  

Note: This adapter is supported on linux systems only.

@ChatGPT (Info from GitHub (Basic concept
Viessmann E3 series devices (One Base) are doing a lot of data exchange on CAN bus.

This adapter can listen to this communication and extract many useful information. Energy meter E380CA and E3100CB also are supported. This mode of operation is called Collect.

In parallel reading and writing of data points is supported. Informations not available via listening can be actively requested. By writing to data points it's possible to change setpoints, schedules and so on. It's even possible to add new schedules e.g. for domestic hot water circulation pump. This mode of operation is called UDSonCAN. The UDSonCAN protocol (Universal Diagnostic Services based on CAN bus) is also used by other equipment, e.g. by well known WAGO gateway.

Writing of data is triggered by storing the corresponding state with Acknowledged not checked (ack=false) - yes, it's that simple! The data point will be read again from device and stored in the state 2.5 seconds after writing. If state not get's acknowledged, please take a look to the logs.

Writing is restricted to a set of data points using a white list. The list is stored in the info section of each device, e.g. at e3oncan.0.vitocal.info.udsDidsWritable. You can add more data points by editing this state. Make sure, not to check Acknowledged when saving the state.

During first start of adapter instance a device scan will be done providing a list of all available E3 devices for configuration dialog (energy meters are not listed). A scan for data points of each E3 device should be done during first setup, details see below.

Which modes of operation (Collect and/or UDSonCAN) can be used depends on your device topology. Additional information is available here.

For possible use cases please refer to this discussion (under construction).

Important parts of this adpater are based on the project open3e.

A python based implementation of a pure listening approach (Collect only) using MQTT messaging is also availabe, see E3onCAN.

Note: Support for Node.js 22 not fully tested yet!)
